\title{Supervised Mobile Manipulator}
\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
Teleoperation in robotics was the first widespread application of robots. 
It was mainly used in applications involving operations in hazardous area for humans (space, 
radioactive, high temperatures, etc.)

The Supervised Mobile Manipulator (SMM) project goals was to build a robotic system used for
teleoperation from remote area. It is using one robot performing a task and another robot as 
"assistant" to provide help to the operator when performing manipulation actions.
In this paper we will present the platforms and tools we have used, then we will present our
works made on the robotics system and finally present our experiences and results.
